          The newest iteration of Colorworks was established between 2018 and 2019,
          bringing on myself as bassist/vocalist, Deno Durant on drums, and Ash Einhorn on keys.
          2018 started with a bang, as we released our self-titled Colorworks EP, an indie rock
          music collection consisting of old members and new, and we won
          a battle of the bands playing music off that record. We've played together all over
          the PNW, including classic Seattle venues such as The Sunset Tavern, Barboza, Nectar Lounge, Tractor Tavern,
          The High Dive, and many others. We've since released 2 new EPs a single, and a full-length 
          album titled Vuja De. Check out the live footage below from our show at Conor Byrne Pub in Ballard, WA!

          What started as a casual song-writing project with a good friend (Jesse Quigley) during the pandemic,
          turned into a fiery, passion-filled musical endeavor that allowed us to showcase our
          writing and musical style, as well as give us a creative outlet during a less than sublime
          period of time. The Candyflowers "Mind Folly" EP is an indie rock collection that 
          seeks to give listeners a bumpin' rock experience with melancholic lyrics that can be 
          interpreted in whatever way fits the narrative of the listener. Check out our music on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/55IAGDbs3x248WAQrPC2hl" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;"> Spotify! </a>
